[A18]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction.
[A19]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement "Sam is handsome" is consistent with the second statement "Sam is either handsome or tall." According to the second statement, Sam could be tall as well, but it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, there is no contradiction.
[A20]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. Both statements can be true at the same time.

[Q19]
Do the following statements form a contradiction? Sam is handsome. Sam is neither handsome nor tall.
[A1]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. The first statement says that Sam is handsome, while the second statement says that Sam is neither handsome nor tall. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time and therefore, contradict each other.
[A2]
Yes, the statements "Sam is handsome" and "Sam is neither handsome nor tall" form a contradiction. The contradiction arises from the fact that the first statement claims Sam is handsome while the second statement claims Sam is not handsome.
[A4]
Yes, the statements do form a contradiction because the first statement "Sam is handsome" implies that Sam is handsome, while the second statement "Sam is neither handsome nor tall" contradicts that by saying Sam is not handsome.
[A5]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. The first statement "Sam is handsome" states that Sam is indeed handsome, while the second statement "Sam is neither handsome nor tall" denies that Sam is handsome.
[A6]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. The first statement states that Sam is handsome, while the second statement states that Sam is neither handsome nor tall. Since the second statement contradicts the first statement, these two statements cannot both be true at the same time.
[A7]
Yes, the statements do form a contradiction. The first statement indicates that Sam is handsome, while the second statement states that Sam is neither handsome nor tall. These two statements cannot be true at the same time, making them contradictory.
[A8]

[A9]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction.
[A10]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. 

The first statement states that Sam is handsome, while the second statement states that Sam is neither handsome nor tall. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, they create a contradiction.
[A11]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction because in the first statement it is claimed that Sam is handsome, while in the second statement it is claimed that Sam is neither handsome nor tall.
[A12]
Yes, the following statements form a contradiction. The first statement, "Sam is handsome," implies that Sam is indeed handsome. However, the second statement contradicts the first statement by stating, "Sam is neither handsome nor tall." This means that Sam is not handsome, which contradicts the initial statement.
[A13]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. The first statement asserts that Sam is handsome, while the second statement negates that by stating that Sam is neither handsome nor tall. Since "neither handsome nor tall" includes the negation of being handsome, the two statements contradict each other.
[A14]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. The first statement states that Sam is handsome, while the second statement states that Sam is neither handsome nor tall. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time.
[A15]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. If it is stated that Sam is handsome, but then it is also stated that he is neither handsome nor tall, it contradicts the initial statement.
[A16]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. Saying that "Sam is handsome" conflicts with the second statement "Sam is neither handsome nor tall", which implies that Sam is not handsome.
[A17]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. The first statement claims that Sam is handsome, while the second statement contradicts this by stating that Sam is neither handsome nor tall.
[A18]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction.

[Q20]
Do the following statements form a contradiction? Sam is handsome. Sam is either not handsome or not tall.
[A1]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. The first statement states that "Sam is handsome" and the second statement states that "Sam is either not handsome or not tall." If the first statement is true, then Sam is handsome. However, the second statement states that Sam is either not handsome, which contradicts the first statement.
[A2]
Yes, the statements do form a contradiction. If Sam is handsome and the second statement is true, then Sam would have to be not tall, contradicting the first statement.
[A3]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. If "Sam is handsome" is true, then the second statement "Sam is either not handsome or not tall" must be false.
[A4]
Yes, the following statements form a contradiction. If Sam is handsome but is either not handsome or not tall, then it contradicts the initial statement that Sam is handsome.
[A5]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. They can coexist if Sam is not tall, but is still considered handsome.
[A6]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. They can both be true if Sam is not tall.
[A7]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement, "Sam is handsome," does not contradict the second statement, "Sam is either not handsome or not tall." It is possible for Sam to be handsome and not tall.
[A8]
No, these statements do not form a contradiction.
[A9]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction.

The first statement states that Sam is handsome, implying that he has a pleasing appearance. In contrast, the second statement states that Sam is either not handsome or not tall. Therefore, if we assume Sam is not handsome according to the second statement, it contradicts the information given in the first statement. On the other hand, assuming Sam is not tall would mean he is not handsome as per the second statement. Thus, regardless of the interpretation, the statements contradict each other.
[A10]
Yes, the following statements form a contradiction. If Sam is handsome, and the second statement says that Sam is either not handsome or not tall, it implies that Sam is not handsome, which contradicts the first statement.
[A11]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. While the second statement presents two possibilities (either Sam is not handsome or not tall), it does not contradict the first statement, which simply states that Sam is handsome. It is possible for Sam to be handsome and not tall.
[A12]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement "Sam is handsome" does not directly contradict the second statement "Sam is either not handsome or not tall." It is possible that Sam is not handsome and not tall, which would make both statements true. However, it is also possible that Sam is handsome but not tall, which would still make the second statement true. Therefore, the statements do not necessarily contradict each other.
[A13]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement "Sam is handsome" does not provide any contradiction with the second statement "Sam is either not handsome or not tall." These statements can both be true.
[A14]
No, these statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement "Sam is handsome" could be true regardless of the truth value of the second statement "Sam is either not handsome or not tall." The second statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options ("not handsome" or "not tall") can be true while the statement as a whole is still true. Therefore, there is no inherent contradiction between the two statements.
[A15]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. The first statement asserts that Sam is handsome, while the second statement implies that Sam is not handsome (it states that Sam is either not handsome or not tall).
[A16]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction because if Sam is handsome, it contradicts the second statement which states that Sam is either not handsome or not tall.
[A17]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement, "Sam is handsome," does not directly contradict the second statement, "Sam is either not handsome or not tall." The second statement allows for the possibility that Sam is not handsome but does not require it. Therefore, the statements can be simultaneously true if Sam is not tall but still considered handsome.
[A18]
Yes, the following statements do form a contradiction. If it is stated that Sam is handsome, but then it is stated that Sam is either not handsome or not tall, it means that one part of the statement is saying Sam is handsome and another part is saying he is not handsome. Therefore, it contradicts itself.
[A19]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. Contradictions occur when two statements oppose each other and cannot simultaneously be true. In this case, the second statement provides two possibilities: that Sam is either not handsome or not tall. It does not directly contradict the first statement that Sam is handsome.
[A20]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. If Sam is handsome (as stated in the first statement), and the second statement says that Sam is either not handsome or not tall, then the second statement contradicts the first.

[A3]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. Both statements can be true if Sam is indeed both handsome and tall.
[A4]
No, these statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement simply states that Sam is handsome, while the second statement adds that Sam is both handsome and tall. Both statements can be true simultaneously.
[A5]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. Both statements can be true at the same time.
[A6]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. They may both be true. The second statement simply adds another quality (being tall) to the characterization of Sam, without negating the first statement about him being handsome.
[A7]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. If Sam is both handsome and tall, it means he possesses the qualities of being both handsome and tall, which is not contradictory.
[A8]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. If Sam is handsome, it does not necessarily mean he cannot also be tall.
[A9]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement states that Sam is handsome, while the second statement adds that Sam is both handsome and tall. Being handsome and tall are not mutually exclusive attributes, so both statements can be true.
[A10]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement states that Sam is handsome, while the second statement adds that he is both handsome and tall. These statements are not contradictory, as it is possible for someone to be both handsome and tall.
[A11]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement simply asserts that Sam is handsome, while the second statement adds that Sam is both handsome and tall. There is no inherent contradiction between being handsome and being tall.

[A17]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. They may be both true if Sam is both handsome and tall.
[A18]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The second statement is simply reaffirming the first statement and adding that Sam is also tall.
[A20]

However, the second statement contradicts this by stating that Sam is neither handsome nor tall, implying that Sam lacks both of these qualities.
[A8]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. The first statement implies that Sam is either handsome or tall, meaning he must possess at least one of these traits. However, the second statement directly contradicts this by stating that Sam is neither handsome nor tall, meaning he possesses none of these traits. Thus, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time, forming a contradiction.
[A9]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction because they directly contradict each other. The first statement suggests that Sam is either handsome or tall, while the second statement states that Sam is neither handsome nor tall.
[A10]
Yes, these statements form a contradiction. The first statement states that Sam is either handsome or tall, indicating that he possesses at least one of these qualities. However, the second statement contradicts this by saying that Sam is neither handsome nor tall. Therefore, it is impossible for both statements to be true simultaneously.
[A11]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction because they directly contradict each other. The first statement states that Sam is either handsome or tall, implying that he possesses at least one of those traits. However, the second statement denies both traits, stating that Sam is neither handsome nor tall. It is not possible for Sam to be both handsome or tall and neither handsome nor tall at the same time.

[A14]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement indicates that Sam is either handsome or tall, which means he could possess one of those qualities or possibly both. The second statement states that Sam is both handsome and tall. These statements can be consistent if Sam possesses both qualities.
[A15]
The statements do not form a contradiction. They could be contradictory if the first statement stated that Sam is either handsome or tall, and the second statement stated that Sam is neither handsome nor tall.

[A3]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement presents two options for Sam's qualities (handsome or tall), while the second statement presents the negation of those options (not handsome or not tall). Both statements can be true at the same time if Sam is neither handsome nor tall.
[A4]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction.

[A14]
Yes, the statements form a contradiction. The first statement implies that Sam is either handsome or tall, while the second statement implies that Sam is not both handsome and tall. This contradicts the first statement, as it suggests that Sam cannot be both handsome and not handsome, or both tall and not tall at the same time.
[A15]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. They are both compatible and can be true at the same time.
[A16]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. They actually form the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either that proposition is true or its negation is true. In this case, the proposition is "Sam is either handsome or tall", and its negation is "Sam is neither handsome nor tall". Therefore, the statements are consistent.
[A17]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. They are consistent with each other.
[A18]
No, the statements do not form a contradiction. The first statement states that Sam is either handsome or tall. The second statement states that Sam is either not handsome or not tall.
