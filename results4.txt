[Q1]
Suppose all of the A are B, and all of the B are C. What can be inferred about the relationship between A and C? Use quantifiers "all", "none", or "some".
[A1]
Using the given information, we can infer that "some" of the A are C.
[A2]
Some A are C.
[A3]
All of A are C.
[A4]
From the given statements, it can be inferred that "some" (at least one) of the A are C.
[A5]
Using the given information, we can infer that "some" of the A are C.
[A6]
All of A are C.
[A7]
Based on the given information, the relationship between A and C can be inferred as follows:

"All of the A are C." 

This can be logically deduced because if all of the A are B, and all of the B are C, then it follows that all of the A must also be C.
[A8]
All of the A are C.
[A9]
All A are C.
[A10]
All of the A are C.
[A11]
All of A are C.
[A12]
Since the statement says "all of the A are B" and "all of the B are C," it can be inferred that "all of the A are C."
[A13]
From the given information, we can infer that "all of the A are C".
[A14]
All A are C.
[A15]
Based on the given information, we can infer that "some" of the A are C.
[A16]
If all of the A are B and all of the B are C, then it can be inferred that all of the A are C.
[A17]
All of the A are C.
[A18]
All of the A are C.
[A19]
Based on the given information, it can be inferred that "some" of the A are C.
[A20]
All of the A are C.

[Q2]
Suppose all of the A are B, and none of the B is C. What can be inferred about the relationship between A and C? Use quantifiers "all", "none", or "some".
[A1]
Based on the given information, it cannot be inferred anything about the relationship between A and C. Since it is only stated that all of A are B and none of B is C, there is no direct information regarding the relationship between A and C.
[A2]
Based on the information given, we can infer that "none of the A is C".
[A3]
From the given information, we can infer that "some of the A are not C." This is because if all of the A are B, and none of the B is C, it implies that there are at least some A that do not fall into the category of C.
[A4]
Based on the given information, it can be inferred that "some" of A is not C.
[A5]
Using the given information, we can make the following inference about the relationship between A and C:

- Some of the A are not C.
[A6]
Based on the given information, we can infer that "Some of the A are not C". This is because all of the A are B and none of the B is C. So, there may exist some A that are not B, and since none of the B is C, those particular A would also not be C.
[A7]
Based on the given information, we can infer that "some" A is not C. However, we cannot infer anything about the relationship between "all" A and C.
[A8]
Based on the given information, we can infer "some" relationship between A and C.
[A9]
Some A may not be C.
[A10]
None of the A is C.
[A11]
Given the statements "all of the A are B" and "none of the B is C," the relationship between A and C can be inferred using quantifiers. We can conclude that "none of the A is C" because if all A are B and none of B is C, then none of A can be C.
[A12]
From the given information, it can be inferred that some of A could be C, but it cannot be determined with certainty.
[A13]
From the given information, we can infer that "some" of A is not C.
[A14]
Some C are not A.
[A15]
None of the B is C.
[A16]
No inference can be made about the relationship between A and C based on the given information.
[A17]
Based on the given information, it can be inferred that "none" of the A is C.
[A18]
No conclusion can be inferred about the relationship between A and C based on the given information.
[A19]
From the given information, it can be inferred that "some" of the A can be C.
[A20]
Based on the given information, we can infer that some of the A are not C.

[Q3]
Suppose some of the A are B, and all of the B is C. What can be inferred about the relationship between A and C? Use quantifiers "all", "none", or "some".
[A1]
From the given statements, it can be inferred that "some of the A are C".
[A2]
Some of the A are C.
[A3]
Some A are C.
[A4]
Some of the A are C.
[A5]
Some of A are C.
[A6]
Based on the given information, it can be inferred that "some of the A are C". This is because if some of the A are B and all of the B is C, it indicates that there is at least one common element between A and C, thus establishing a "some" relationship.
[A7]
All of A is C.
[A8]
From the given information, it can be inferred using the quantifier "some" that "some of the A are C".
[A9]
Some of the A are C.
[A10]
Some of the A are C.
[A11]
Some of the A are C.
[A12]
Some of A are C.
[A13]
Some of the A are C.
[A14]
Some of the A are C.
[A15]
Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that some of the A are C.
[A16]
Some of the A are definitely C because if some of the A are B, and all of the B is C, then it implies that at least some of the A are C.
[A17]
All of the A are C.
[A18]
From the given information, it can be inferred that "some" of the A are C.
[A19]
Some of the A are C.
[A20]
Some of the A are C.

[Q4]
Suppose none of the A is B, and all of the C are B. What can be inferred about the relationship between A and C? Use quantifiers "all", "none", or "some".
[A1]
If none of the A is B and all of the C are B, then it can be inferred that "some" A is not C.
[A2]
Based on the given information, it can be inferred that some of the C are not A.
[A3]
Based on the given information, it can be inferred that "Some of the C are not A."
[A4]
From the given information, we can conclude that "some" of the A are not C.
[A5]
Based on the statements provided, no conclusive inference can be made about the relationship between A and C.
[A6]
Based on the given information, we can infer that some (at least one) of the C are not A. This is because none of the A is B, which means that all of the A are not B. Since all of the C are B, and none of the A are B, it implies that at least one of the C is not A. Therefore, we can conclude that some (at least one) of the C are not A.
[A7]
From the given information, we can infer that "all C are not A" or "none of the C are A." We cannot make any direct conclusion about the relationship between A and C except for the fact that they do not have any overlapping members based on the provided statements.
[A8]
Some of the A are not C.
[A9]
Based on the given information, it can be inferred that "some" of the A are not C.
[A10]
Based on the given information, we can infer that "Some of the C are not A."
[A11]
Based on the given information, we can infer that the relationship between A and C can only be "some."

The statement "none of the A is B" means that there is no overlap between A and B. However, "all of the C are B" means that all C elements are included in the set B.

Since there is no shared element between A and B, and all C elements are in B, we can conclude that there may be some elements in C that are not in A. In other words, there is a possibility of a partial overlap between A and C, but not a complete overlap. Hence, the relationship between A and C can be inferred as "some."
[A12]
Based on the given statement, "none of the A is B, and all of the C are B," we can infer that there is no direct relationship between A and C. In other words, we cannot make any conclusive statements about the relationship between A and C based on the information provided.
[A13]
Based on the given information, we can infer that "some of the C are not A". 

This can be deduced as follows:
- None of the A is B implies that there is no overlap between A and B.
- All of the C are B implies that C is entirely contained within B.
- Since B contains all of C and none of A, there must be some elements in C that are not in A. Hence, we can conclude that "some of the C are not A".
[A14]
Based on the given information, we can infer that "None of the A is C."
[A15]
If none of the A is B and all of the C are B, we can infer that some of the A are not C.
[A16]
We can infer that some of the C may or may not be A.
[A17]
Based on the given premises, we can infer that the relationship between A and C is indeterminate.
[A18]
Based on the given information, we can infer that some of the C are not A. 

Since none of the A is B, this means that there is no overlap between A and B. Therefore, any element that belongs to A cannot belong to B, indicating that some of the C cannot be A.

However, no information is provided about whether all or none of the A are C.
[A19]
Based on the given information, it can be inferred that the relationship between A and C is indeterminate.
[A20]
Based on the given information, we can infer that "None of the A is C."
